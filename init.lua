description = [[This adds new weapon types and egos to the game.

- Tridents are unchanged, but generate more often.
- Whips can now generate normally, and their accuracy bonus now slows the target.
- Swordbreakers are weak knives that have a chance to disarm on hit, and give bonuses to dual weapon defense.
- Rapiers are 1h weapons that use dagger mastery and rely on strength, dexterity, and cunning.
- Spears are slow weapons that can attack from a distance.
- Clubs are maces that can pick up mindstar egos.
- Throwing knives can be used in melee or as a short ranged attack with the shoot talent.
- Daggers will now use the higher of strength or cunning if you don't have Lethality.
- Mindslayers can now equip ranged weapons in their psionic focus slot.
- Aurastones are magic-based items that can be equipped to modify your unarmed attacks.

This also adds Magic Weapon Mastery, which applies to staves, aurastones, and sceptres, and can be learned in Angolwen.

This also includes all the changes made in the Archery Tweaks mod as an option, and should not be used with the Archery Tweaks mod.]]
