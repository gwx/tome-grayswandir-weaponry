description = [[This adds new weapon types and egos to the game.

- Tridents are unchanged, but generate more often.
- Whips can now generate normally, and their accuracy bonus now slows the target.
- Swordbreakers are weak knives that have a chance to disarm on hit, and give bonuses to dual weapon defense.
- Rapiers are 1h weapons that use dagger mastery and rely on strength, dexterity, and cunning.
- Bucklers are light shields that can greatly increase your defense and give you faster attacks against those who miss you in melee.
- Spears/Greatspears are slow weapons that can attack from a distance.
- Clubs/Greatclubs are maces that can pick up mindstar egos.
- Throwing knives can be used in melee or as a short ranged attack with the shoot talent.
- Daggers will now use the higher of strength or cunning if you don't have Lethality.
- Mindslayers can now equip ranged weapons in their psionic focus slot.
- Aurastones are magic-based items that can be equipped to modify your unarmed attacks.
- For archery, you can switch between old style reloading, instant style reloading, or completely ignore ammo altogether.
- Magic Weapon Mastery applies to staves, aurastones, ritual knives, and sceptres, and can be learned in Angolwen.
